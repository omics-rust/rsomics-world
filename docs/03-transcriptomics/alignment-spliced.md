# Spliced alignment (bulk RNA-seq)

> Mapping RNA-seq reads to a genome while detecting and respecting splice
> junctions.

## Scope

Covers RNA-only / splice-aware aligners. Unspliced DNA aligners (BWA,
bowtie2) live in [`02-genomics/alignment-short-read.md`](../02-genomics/alignment-short-read.md).
Pseudo / selective alignment (Salmon, kallisto) is in
[`quantification.md`](quantification.md) because its output is abundance,
not a BAM. Long-read RNA aligners (minimap2 `-x splice`) are listed but the
core minimap2 entry is in module 02.

## Design notes

- STAR's two-pass algorithm and on-disk genome suffix array are the
  performance baseline; any rewrite needs SIMD-accelerated seed extension
  and careful memory layout — the 30 GB index footprint is the single
  most painful aspect of STAR in pipelines.
- HISAT2's hierarchical FM-index is more memory-frugal and a more
  Rust-friendly target (Rust has solid FM-index crates in `rust-bio`).
  A pure-Rust HISAT-style aligner is the most tractable splice-aware
  rewrite.
- TopHat2 / MapSplice are legacy and only ported for archival / pipeline
  compatibility reasons. Authors of TopHat (Trapnell) actively redirect
  users to HISAT2.
- Long-read splice mapping is already well served by `minimap2-rs` (FFI).
  A pure-Rust long-read splice aligner would be a separate engineering
  effort and is lower priority than a short-read solution.

## TODO

- [ ] **`STAR`** — splice-aware short-read aligner with built-in chimeric read detection.
  - Reference impl: `C++` · [alexdobin/STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) · `MIT`
  - Existing Rust: none pure-Rust. STAR-Fusion bindings exist only as pipeline wrappers.
  - Existing Rust kind: `none`
  - Existing non-C alternatives: STARsolo (extension, same codebase, C++)
  - Parallelism: upstream pthreads
  - SIMD: upstream SSE / AVX in extension kernel
  - Quadrant: —
  - GPU-amenable: maybe — seed extension is SW (SIMT-amenable); the on-disk suffix array probe is memory-bandwidth-bound
  - Upstream license: `MIT`
  - Priority: `P0`
  - Layer: `B` (tool — `rsomics-star`)
  - Consumes primitives: `rsomics-fm-index`, `block-aligner`, `noodles-bam`, `noodles-fasta`, `noodles-gff` (for the `--sjdbGTFfile` splice-junction guide), future `rsomics-stats` for SJ.out.tab
  - Notes: Memory-hungry but the de-facto pipeline standard (ENCODE, GTEx, TCGA). Pure-Rust rewrite is a Phase-2+ project; an FFI binding is the realistic first step. Output is a CellRanger-compatible BAM + SJ.out.tab — both already covered by `noodles`.

- [ ] **`HISAT2`** — hierarchical FM-index spliced aligner.
  - Reference impl: `C++` · [DaehwanKimLab/hisat2](https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/hisat2) · `GPL-3.0`
  - Existing Rust: none verified
  - Existing Rust kind: `none`
  - Existing non-C alternatives: HISAT-genotype (same authors, same code)
  - Parallelism: upstream pthreads
  - SIMD: upstream SSE
  - Quadrant: —
  - GPU-amenable: maybe — same SW kernel rationale as bwa-mem; index probing is memory-bound
  - Upstream license: `GPL-3.0`
  - Priority: `P0`
  - Layer: `B` (tool — `rsomics-hisat`)
  - Consumes primitives: `rsomics-fm-index` (hierarchical FM-index extension lives here), `block-aligner`, `noodles-bam`, `noodles-fasta`, `noodles-gff`
  - Notes: GPL constrains derivative crates — a clean-room Rust port can be MIT/Apache via the `## Origin` template (see CONVENTIONS.md). FM-index primitives in `rust-bio` and `fm-index` are a credible foundation. Probably the most realistic full short-read splice aligner to attempt.

- [ ] **`TopHat2`** — first widely-used RNA-seq spliced aligner; built on bowtie2.
  - Reference impl: `C++` · [DaehwanKimLab/tophat](https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/tophat) · `Artistic-2.0`
  - Existing Rust: none verified
  - Existing Rust kind: `none`
  - Existing non-C alternatives: HISAT2 is the official successor
  - Parallelism: upstream pthreads (limited)
  - SIMD: none
  - Quadrant: —
  - GPU-amenable: no — legacy, not worth restructuring
  - Upstream license: `Artistic-2.0`
  - Priority: `P2`
  - Layer: —
  - Consumes primitives: —
  - Notes: Officially deprecated by its authors (Kim, Pertea, Salzberg) in favour of HISAT2. Listed only because legacy GEO / SRA submissions still reference TopHat2 BAMs; no port needed.

- [ ] **`Subjunc`** — junction-aware aligner from the Subread package.
  - Reference impl: `C` · [Subread / Rsubread](https://subread.sourceforge.net/) · `GPL-3.0`
  - Existing Rust: none verified
  - Existing Rust kind: `none`
  - Existing non-C alternatives: —
  - Parallelism: upstream pthreads
  - SIMD: limited
  - Quadrant: —
  - GPU-amenable: no — limited use base, not worth the engineering
  - Upstream license: `GPL-3.0`
  - Priority: `P2`
  - Layer: `subcommand-of-rsomics-subread` (within the Subread/featureCounts umbrella)
  - Consumes primitives: `rsomics-fm-index`, `noodles-bam`, `noodles-fasta`
  - Notes: Used mostly by R users via Rsubread; standalone usage is rare. Worth at least an `extendr` wrapper rather than a rewrite — the C code is small and stable.

- [ ] **`MapSplice`** — junction-aware aligner used heavily by TCGA legacy pipelines.
  - Reference impl: `C++ / Perl` · [MapSplice2 mirror](https://github.com/davidroberson/MapSplice2) · `unspecified open source` — **mirror is dead (last update 2017-10)**
  - Existing Rust: none verified
  - Existing Rust kind: `none`
  - Existing non-C alternatives: —
  - Parallelism: upstream pthreads + Perl glue
  - SIMD: none
  - Quadrant: —
  - GPU-amenable: no — legacy tool, no upside
  - Upstream license: unspecified open source
  - Priority: `P2`
  - Layer: —
  - Consumes primitives: —
  - Notes: Largely superseded by STAR + HISAT2. Keep for TCGA replication work; not a porting target. The mirror at `davidroberson/MapSplice2` is the only public copy and has not been updated since 2017 (well past the 18-month aliveness threshold); logged in `.autopilot/needs-review/external-2026-05-14.md`.
