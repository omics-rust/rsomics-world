# rsomics-world

A Cargo workspace of single-binary CLI tools that displace the C/Python/R-era
bioinformatics toolchain with **modern Rust**: fearless parallelism, explicit
SIMD, a sane installer (`cargo install rsomics-<name>`), no build-system
ceremony.

**Status**: 162 crates (143 active tool binaries) across
FASTQ (30), BED (34), FASTA (32), VCF (22), GFF (16), BAM/SAM (13),
single-cell (inferCNV), transcriptomics (featureCounts), alignment
(minimap2 FFI), and genomic utilities (bbduk). 85+ published on
crates.io with 50+ more tagging. All tools pass CI: fmt, clippy
pedantic, tests on Linux (stable + MSRV 1.91) + macOS.

Most upstream tools are single-threaded, memory-inefficient, and written in
2005-era C or pure R. Modern multicore + SIMD + GPU resources sit idle. The
goal of `rsomics-*` is to put them to work, tool by tool, while staying
binary-compatible with upstream so existing pipelines can swap in piecewise.

## Architecture

Two layers, one workspace, one git repo. See [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md)
for the rules; the short version:

- `crates/foundation/` — **Layer A**, library-only primitives (IO, intervals,
  k-mers, FM-index, alignment cores, stats). A crate is in A iff ≥ 2 tools
  depend on it.
- `crates/tools/<domain>/` — **Layer B**, each crate is **one operation**
  (`rsomics-fastq-trim`, `rsomics-fasta-stats`, `rsomics-bam-view`, …). The
  partition is per-function, not per-upstream-binary — Swiss-army wraps like
  `samtools` get split into `view` / `sort` / `index` / `markdup` / … crates.
- Dependency direction is **B → A → external**, enforced. A never depends on
  B; B never depends on B; sharing happens through A.

Per-domain planning lives under [`docs/`](docs/):

Each module's `README.md` is the scope file; the topic files inside carry
TODO checklists using the entry schema in [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md).
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is the flat aggregated view across modules.

## Status

Public monorepo workspace. Published pilots:

- [`rsomics-fasta-stats`](crates/tools/formats/rsomics-fasta-stats/) — Rust port of
  `seqkit stats` (FASTA subset), `cargo install rsomics-fasta-stats`.
- [`rsomics-fastq-trim`](crates/tools/formats/rsomics-fastq-trim/) — fastp's adapter /
  poly-G / poly-X / fixed-length trim hot path, `cargo install rsomics-fastq-trim`.

Foundation primitives live under `crates/foundation/` (`rsomics-common`,
`rsomics-help`). The full ~150-crate partition catalog lives in
[`docs/`](docs/) and [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).

## Why Rust?

See [`docs/00-overview/motivation.md`](docs/00-overview/motivation.md). Short
version: memory safety, fearless parallelism (`rayon`), modern packaging
(`cargo`), explicit SIMD (`std::simd`), and a maturing scientific stack
(`ndarray`, `polars`, `arrow`, `candle`) make Rust a credible host language
for the next generation of bioinformatics tools — much of which is still
written in 2005-era C with hand-rolled allocators and brittle Autotools
builds.

## How to read this repo

- Start with [`docs/00-overview/`](docs/00-overview/) for context and
  principles.
- Browse module READMEs for scope.
- [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is the cross-module checklist.
- [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) covers architecture, the TODO schema,
  the external-dependency quadrants, license + clean-room rules, and the
  four first-class platform targets.
