# rsomics-world — Autopilot Operating Manual

You are running in **autopilot mode** on the `rsomics-world` repository at `/Volumes/Zane's HDD/Documents/rsomics-world/`. This file is loaded every session — it is the constitution. The current Phase's prompt is the law of the current period.

## Mission

Plan and build a **monorepo cargo workspace** of `rsomics-<name>` single-binary CLI tools — "many bcmrs" — that displace the C/Python/R-era bioinformatics toolchain. The motivation is concrete: most upstream tools are single-threaded, memory-inefficient, written in 2005-era C or pure R, and waste modern multicore + SIMD + GPU resources.

Quality bar per tool: **fail-fast, fail-loud, single binary, easy to install (`cargo install rsomics-<name>`), zero defensive programming, self-explaining code**.

### Scale + cadence (this is an indefinite campaign, not a project)

The upstream reference set being reconstructed is **300+ packages**. After
deduping overlapping functions but applying the per-function partition
rule (one operation = one crate) — and exploding swiss-army-knife
upstreams like `samtools`/`bedtools`/`bcftools`/`picard` into their many
constituent operations — the rsomics-* crate count is **necessarily far
larger than 300**, plausibly multiple thousands. This is a long
autonomous campaign with no fixed end date.

**Time does not matter; correctness and the perf contract do. Take your
time.** Never trade a verification gate, a FreshEye review, or the
strict `>1.0×` perf gate for speed. Run **24×7 and autonomously**: do
not pause for permission at phase/domain/crate boundaries, do not
courtesy-halt, do not ask "should I continue". The campaign only stops
for the universal correctness halts or a genuine only-user decision —
and those are raised out-of-band via Telegram (see
`feedback-telegram-alerts` memory), not by stopping and waiting in chat.

### Dependency rules (one-way, enforced)

- B → A → external. **A never depends on B. B never depends on B directly** — share via A.
- A is **library-only** (no `[[bin]]`). A crate with a binary is by definition B.
- Promote internal module to A only when **2+ B crates** need it (YAGNI; do not pre-abstract).

### Crate partition rule (per-function, not per-upstream-binary)

We are explicitly **NOT a Swiss-Army-knife project**. Each Layer B crate
is **one function** — the operation a user / pipeline / agent would invoke
on its own. Upstream binaries like `samtools` and `fastp` are themselves
Swiss-Army knives (samtools = view + sort + index + merge + markdup +
mpileup + faidx + flagstat + idxstats + depth + …); wrapping them 1:1
inherits that anti-pattern. So we don't.

**Workflow when introducing crates for a new domain** (e.g. FASTQ, BAM,
VCF, alignment, quantification, …):

1. **Survey the function set** by reading actual upstream source. Per
   format / domain, list every function each upstream tool provides
   (samtools' subcommands, fastp's flag groups, picard's tools, …).
   Read the source — do not list from memory.
2. **Aggregate across tools** in the domain. Many tools cover the same
   operation (samtools markdup vs picard MarkDuplicates).
3. **Dedupe**. The unit of dedup is the operation, not the binary.
4. **Group by coherent operation** at a granularity a user would
   recognise — "view a BAM" is one crate, "view a BAM with region filter"
   is not its own crate (it's a flag inside view).
5. **One crate per operation**. Binary name = `rsomics-<format>-<op>` for
   tool crates (e.g. `rsomics-bam-sort`); library name = `rsomics-<topic>`
   for foundation crates.

For tools that DO span multiple operations functionally (rare — e.g. an
aligner that emits sorted BAM directly), document the operation list
explicitly in the crate's README and justify the bundling.

### Implementation discipline (read source, don't reconstruct from memory)

Before writing any non-trivial algorithm, **read the upstream
reference implementation's source** (subject to clean-room rules below
for GPL upstreams). Goals:

- Catch behavioural details a paper or man page omits (off-by-one
  semantics, exact filter-precedence ordering, exact format-tag wording).
- Avoid reconstructing from memory and then discovering compat
  divergences via the compat test much later.
- Surface the source's hot-loop shape so our Rust version can match
  or beat it deliberately, not accidentally.

For **GPL** upstreams, the clean-room rule still applies — we read
**paper + format spec + black-box behaviour**, not the GPL source. For
**MIT / Apache / BSD** upstreams, reading and citing the source is
allowed and expected. Document in the crate's `## Origin` README section
which sources informed the implementation.

### External dependency 4-quadrant classification

For every adopted external crate, classify and document in its TODO entry:

| Quadrant | What it is | Acceptable for | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① Pure Rust + explicit parallelism (rayon / std::simd) | E.g. noodles, rayon, polars, needletail | Adopt freely | This is the goal state |
| ② FFI wrapper over C (`cc`, `bindgen`, `*-sys`) | E.g. rust-htslib, minimap2-rs | Adopt for speed, but **document clearly: "FFI wrapper, not Rust rewrite"** | C upstream stays the perf reference; future P2 may pure-Rust replace |
| ③ Pure Rust but single-threaded in hot path | (varies — must verify per case) | **Avoid** in hot paths | Inherits the disease we're curing |
| ④ Pure Rust, non-hot, edge utility | clap, serde, anyhow, regex | Adopt freely | Doesn't matter |

When adopting, the TODO entry's `Existing Rust kind` field records ①②③④ explicitly.

## Autonomous campaign continuity (heartbeat)

A multi-thousand-crate 24×7 campaign cannot depend on one chat session
staying alive. A **cron heartbeat** (CronCreate, autonomous-loop mode)
re-invokes the campaign on an interval so it self-resumes after a stall,
crash, context exhaustion, or session death — the openclaw-style
watchdog. Operating rules:

- The heartbeat is the survival net, **not** the work pace. Within an
  active wake-up, do as much bounded, gate-passing work as is sound,
  then end; the next firing continues from task state.
- **Task list is the durable campaign state.** Every wake-up: read the
  task list, pick up the lowest-id unblocked task, advance it. Never
  rely on in-context memory surviving across firings — write progress to
  tasks / `.autopilot/state` / memory.
- **Idempotent & re-entrant.** A firing may overlap a still-running one
  or restart mid-crate. Check git/crates.io/task state before acting;
  never double-publish, double-tag, or double-yank (all are immutable or
  loud-fail anyway, but check first).
- A firing that finds nothing actionable (waiting on CI, on a
  background agent, on `ssh 4090`) does a cheap status check and ends —
  it does not busy-spin.
- The heartbeat never courtesy-pings the user. Telegram is only for the
  three escalation cases (genuine only-user decision, unresolvable
  correctness halt, real milestone).
- If the heartbeat itself cannot be (re)created or is lost, that is a
  Telegram-worthy correctness event — surface it.

## Operating mode

- **No clarifying questions.** Decide, commit, document the reason in the commit body.
- **Don't stop unless a real decision is needed.** Autopilot means autopilot — and the scope is **wider than one phase**. When the current phase finishes, the next phase is whatever `partition-master` / the latest sub-agent recommendation / the natural follow-up dictates; enter it without surfacing. **Halt only when**: (a) you hit a universal stop condition (the correctness-protecting list below — committing an unverified claim, inventing a name, etc.), (b) the action requires something only the user can supply or do — a personal preference with no prior signal, an unrevealed secret, an account-bound action you can't perform, or a value judgment whose answer isn't recoverable from project context, or (c) a genuine decision materially changes scope or reverses architectural assumptions and you have no prior user signal to act on. Phase boundaries, version bump choices, "is now a good time to publish", "should we start the next foundation crate" — none of these are halt points. Session-end courtesy halts ("opening landed, ready for next session") are not allowed. If the user wanted you to stop, they would say so.
- **Solo, no PRs.** Direct commits to `main`. Conventional prefixes:
  - `docs(<module>):` for catalog content (under `docs/`)
  - `feat(<crate>):` for new crate or feature
  - `fix(<crate>):` for bug fix
  - `refactor(<crate>):` for restructuring
  - `test(<crate>):` for tests
  - `chore:` for housekeeping
  - `ci:` for `.github/workflows/`
- **No `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Ever.**
- **One concern per commit. Fine-grained, push every 3-5 commits.** After every push: `gh run list --branch main --limit 3` and wait for green before tagging.
- **Tag at the natural release moment** — when a crate's `Cargo.toml` version is bumped, CI is green, and the code is publish-ready, push the matching `rsomics-<crate>-v<version>` tag. `publish.yml` + `release.yml` handle the rest. Tag/push/yank/archive-delete are all pre-authorised in this repo (commit history is backup).

## Phase log (record-only, no halt)

Autopilot is autonomous across phases. Phase boundaries are recorded for traceability but do **not** halt execution.

When a phase finishes, write `.autopilot/gates/gate-<N>-<date>.md` summarising:
1. What changed (file list + commit shas).
2. **Decisions taken without asking (with reasoning).** Every autonomous choice — version pins, runner-label substitutions, defaults, schema additions, scope expansions, naming. Distinguish direct user policy from autopilot autonomy; user policy doesn't go here, autonomy does.
3. Needs-review backlog (count + categories).
4. Anything that future sessions or the user need to know to keep context.
5. The next phase entered (and a one-line rationale).

Then **continue into the next phase**. Halt only on the universal stop conditions or true decision points listed in `Operating mode` above.

## Verification gates — non-negotiable, applied to EVERY external claim

For each crate / repo / version mentioned in a TODO entry, run all five before commit:

1. **Existence**: `cargo search <name> --limit 3`. Empty → claim stale → log + skip.
2. **Aliveness**: `gh repo view <owner>/<repo> --json updatedAt,description,isArchived,defaultBranchRef`. Archived or > 18 months stale → downgrade or skip.
3. **Binary shape**: `WebFetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/Cargo.toml`. Look for `[[bin]]`, `default-run`. Record `ships-binary` or `library-only`.
4. **Substance**: `WebFetch` `src/main.rs` or `src/lib.rs`. < ~500 LOC or `unimplemented!()` → stub → downgrade.
5. **Perf-class** (the new gate): in Cargo.toml grep for `cc`, `bindgen`, `*-sys`; check `build.rs` exists. In lib/main.rs grep for `rayon`, `par_iter`, `std::simd`, `packed_simd`, `target_feature`. Fill quadrant ①②③④ in entry.

**Any fetch fails** (404, network, blocked) → append to `.autopilot/needs-review/external-<date>.md` and skip this entry. **NEVER invent a crate name, URL, or version.**

## Code style (enforced in EVERY commit)

- **Fail-fast, fail-loud.** `Result` propagation, no `unwrap_or_default()` to hide errors, no defensive `if let Ok()` swallows. Errors travel to top-level main; main exits non-zero with stderr message. **Wrong output is worse than crash in bioinformatics — bail rather than ship a wrong VCF.**
- **No defensive programming.** Don't validate invariants the type system enforces; don't double-check things already checked at the boundary; don't add retries / fallbacks for cases that can't happen.
- **Comments are persistent.** No `// Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase A / Phase B`, no `// TODO: do later`, no `// removed X`, no `// based on the audit`. If a comment references a temporal state, it's wrong. Comments describe **invariants and non-obvious WHY**, not timelines.
- **No what-comments.** If a comment restates code, delete it. Names carry meaning.
- **Comment heuristic**: ask "would this comment still make sense if a fresh reader saw the code two years from now with no project history?" If no, delete.
- **Pre-commit comment audit**: before every commit touching `.rs` / `.md`, scan the staged diff for comment-rule violations (temporal refs / what-comments / audit-derived language). Fix what you're adding or changing. **Stable comments that have been through many commits stay put** — don't churn them just to match today's stricter reading. Routine audits across many files: dispatch a Sonnet subagent via `Agent(general-purpose, model: "sonnet", ...)` with the file list and rules — Sonnet quota is free for this project.
- **Diagrams**: D2 or Mermaid only. Never ASCII art. (Pre-existing ASCII in `ROADMAP.md` may stay until that file is edited; if edited, convert.)
- **No meta-docs added.** CHANGELOG.md / RELEASING.md / ARCHITECTURE.md do NOT belong in this repo. The release notes live on the GitHub Release. Architecture lives in `CONVENTIONS.md` + `docs/00-overview/`.
- **Unwrap discipline**: prod code uses `unwrap()` only when the invariant is statically obvious (e.g., `slice.first().unwrap()` after a non-empty check at the type level). Tests can unwrap freely.

## Compatibility + perf — the rsomics-* contract

Every Layer B crate that ports a C/Python/R tool MUST have:

- `tests/golden/` — small (KB-MB) reference inputs.
- `tests/compat.rs` — runs the rsomics-* binary, runs the upstream binary, byte-or-field-level diff. **Fail loud on mismatch.**
- `benches/<tool>.rs` — criterion bench against the upstream binary on a non-trivial input. CI tracks regression > 10% on hot path → fail.
- README "Origin" section (license clean-room methodology — see below).

No crate ships without these three. A crate with only `tests/` and no `compat.rs` is an unfinished implementation.

### Performance hard rule — must outperform, not match

Rust is a compiled, manual-memory, no-GC language. Wrapping a C tool and
running *slower* than it is, by construction, an engineering failure on
our side — the C tool's hot loop was visible source we could have
read + matched + beaten. So:

- **No crate is released (no `cargo publish`, no 0.x.0 tag) until its
  hot-path benches show strictly `> 1.0×` throughput vs the upstream
  reference on the same machine.** Same machine, same input, same flags
  to the extent semantics allow.
- **Equal-to-upstream is a failure.** "1.0×" means we offer nothing over
  the C version that a user can't already get; release at that level is
  ecosystem noise.
- **Target ceiling: no upper limit.** Push as far as the algorithm
  allows. "Good enough" is not a stopping criterion before publish.
- **CPU is one axis.** Memory peak / RSS, allocation count, syscall
  count, IO bandwidth, cache behaviour are all in scope. A win on
  wall-clock with a 5× memory blowup is not a win.
- **Single-thread and multi-thread both count.** Some upstreams don't
  expose multi-threading; ours must be faster single-threaded against
  those, and additionally scale multi-threaded.

### Mandatory measurement discipline

Every bench run that informs a publish decision must be **recorded**:

- Tool versions on both sides (commit hash for us, package version for
  upstream — `samtools --version`, `fastp --version` outputs captured).
- Machine identity (mini_m2 / 4090 / CI runner image), thread count,
  whether output was gzipped, etc.
- Input fixture identity (Tier-1/2/3 name, sha256 if applicable).
- Raw timing distribution (hyperfine output preferred — mean ± σ + range
  + sample count).
- Memory metric where relevant (`/usr/bin/time -v` peak RSS on Linux,
  `/usr/bin/time -l` on macOS, or a heaptrack run for allocation count).

Numbers without provenance are not evidence. The crate's `benches/`
output or a checked-in `.autopilot/state/perf-<date>.md` is where they live.

### Bench-driven optimisation hunt

For every crate where the first cut is `> 1.0×` but not by a wide
margin, run a fresh-eye optimisation pass before tagging:

- Profile (Instruments / dtrace / perf / `cargo flamegraph`) on a real
  fixture. Find the top-5 hot functions.
- For each hot function ask: (a) zero-cost abstraction violations?
  vtable in a loop? (b) allocator pressure? per-record `Vec` allocs?
  (c) SIMD-amenable inner loop? (d) cache-hostile access pattern?
  (e) syscall-bound? buffered correctly? (f) lock contention or false
  sharing in parallel paths?
- Dispatch one **`gpt-5.5 medium` Codex** or **`claude-opus-4-7`
  general-purpose** fresh-eye review on the hot loop with the profile
  output attached. Their lens is not yours.
- Re-bench after each optimisation; document the delta.

Memory + cache + syscall axes deserve the same treatment as CPU. Don't
declare done until you've at least *asked* whether each axis has room.

## License + clean-room methodology

Upstream tools have varied licenses. Default for our crates: **MIT OR Apache-2.0**.

For **GPL upstream** (bowtie2, HISAT2, original BWA, MEGAHIT, MMseqs2, Trimmomatic, Subread/featureCounts, SPAdes, IQ-TREE, etc.):

- Our Rust port can still be MIT/Apache-2.0 **only if** the implementation is clean-room: based on the published paper + format spec + black-box behavior observation, NOT on reading the GPL source.
- Each such crate's README MUST contain:

  ```markdown
  ## Origin

  This crate is an independent Rust reimplementation of `<upstream>` based on:
  - The published method (cite paper + DOI)
  - The public file-format spec
  - Black-box behavior testing against the upstream binary

  No source code from the GPL upstream was used as reference during
  implementation. Test fixtures are independently generated or sourced
  from public benchmark datasets (HG002 / 1000 Genomes / etc.).

  License: MIT OR Apache-2.0.
  Upstream credit: <upstream> <link> (<their license>).
  ```

- If clean-room cannot be confirmed for an entry, the entry is downgraded to: defer or write as GPL crate. Flag and surface — do not assume.

For **FFI-wrapper adopt** (rust-htslib, minimap2-rs etc.): record in entry as **Quadrant ②**, credit upstream prominently, document license inheritance.

## Cross-platform target

- **First-class**: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`. CI runs all four. Bench runs Linux x86_64 + aarch64.
- **Not supported**: Windows (skip in CI), other OSes. If a tool's algorithm hinges on Linux-only syscalls (e.g., `splice`), gate behind `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` with a portable fallback.

## CI policy (GitHub Actions)

Workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- `ci.yml`: fmt + clippy + test. Per-push runs a **minimal fast lane** — Linux x86_64 stable (the truth: runs compat tests), Linux x86_64 MSRV `1.91` (rustc-version gate, OS-independent), and one `macos-latest` stable (macOS is the only platform that has ever broken this repo — GH-image rustup poisoning). aarch64-Linux and x86_64-apple-darwin are **not** on the per-push lane; GitHub's Intel-macOS pool is being retired/queue-starved and Actions minutes are finite even on a public repo, so those targets ride the authoritative gate (release.yml on every tag) plus a **weekly `schedule`** that runs the full 4-target × {stable, MSRV} matrix. macOS uses the moving `*-latest` alias, never a pinned version, to avoid label rot. `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` supersedes mid-stack pushes. The all-four-targets coverage invariant holds at release.yml + the weekly sweep, not on every commit.
- `bench.yml`: criterion benches on Linux x86_64 + aarch64, manual trigger. Regression detection.
- `release.yml`: triggered by tag push; builds **all four** first-class-target binaries (incl. x86_64-apple-darwin), uploads to GitHub Release. This is the authoritative pre-publish target gate.

**CI is the truth.** Local Mac smoke is supplementary. After every push, `gh run list --branch main --limit 3` and wait for green before any tag. The tag → release.yml run (not the per-push fast lane) is the gate that must be green before `cargo publish`.

## Disk + environment hygiene (mini_m2 + autopilot)

- **mini_m2's boot disk is small.** All cargo target, all build artifacts, all caches → HDD at `/Volumes/Zane's HDD/`.
- **Session bootstrap (every shell)**:
  ```bash
  export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="/Volumes/Zane's HDD/cargo-target/rsomics-world"
  export CARGO_HOME="/Volumes/Zane's HDD/cargo-home"
  cd "/Volumes/Zane's HDD/Documents/rsomics-world"
  ```
- Run this before every `cargo` invocation. If `df -h /` shows boot disk filling, **halt** and surface.
- `.gitignore`: `/target`, `.autopilot/`, `Cargo.lock` only for binary crates (workspace root keeps the lockfile).

## Test data tiers (CPU/disk-aware)

| Tier | Where | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | inside git (`tests/golden/`) | < 100 MB total | Small synthetic FASTQ/BAM/VCF for unit tests |
| 2 | GitHub Actions runner (downloaded) | < 5 GB ephemeral | chr20/22-subset HG002, public 1000G subsets — integration tests |
| 3 | mini_m2 HDD (`/Volumes/Zane's HDD/rsomics-fixtures/`) | 50-200 GB | One real WGS sample, a few RNA-seq, smoke benchmarks |
| 4 | `ssh 4090:/data3/rsomics-fixtures/` | up to ~1 TB | Multi-sample cohort benches, large-scale perf validation |

Tier 1 in git. Tier 2 downloaded on demand (manifest in repo lists URLs + sha256). Tiers 3-4 manually provisioned; autopilot references via `BCMR_BENCH_DATA` env var.

## GPU strategy

**CPU first, always.** Each TODO entry's Notes records `GPU-amenable: yes/no/maybe` with one-sentence reason, but GPU implementation is gated on:
1. CPU implementation complete + passing compat tests.
2. CPU perf baseline measured.
3. GPU is a measurable win (not a religious win).

GPU testing uses `ssh 4090` (`/data3` for fixtures, `nvidia-smi` available). Framework: `candle` for inference, `burn` if cross-backend is needed.

## Autopilot memory hygiene

- Write `project_*` memory entries for non-obvious discoveries (e.g., "crate X claims pure-Rust but `build.rs` compiles 2000 lines of C — Quadrant ②").
- Don't write transient state (current task, what file I'm editing) to memory — that's session log territory.
- At each gate transition, scan `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` for stale entries and trim. Stale = contradicted by current code, or referencing a phase that's over.

## FreshEye discipline (phase-conditional)

Autopilot cannot audit its own systematic errors. Multi-model / multi-session review catches what self-audit misses. Apply at intensity matching each phase's blast radius.

### Levels

**L0 — no FreshEye** — purely mechanical work (formatting, commit hygiene). Cost > value.

**L1 — sampling spot-check** — every N outputs, dispatch a fresh subagent (different model where possible) to re-audit a random ~10% sample. Mismatches → `.autopilot/needs-review/<topic>-<date>.md` for batched user review. Default for **Phase 1 catalog work** and **non-load-bearing doc edits**.

**L2 — full per-output review** — every significant output (a new public API in a foundation crate, a Layer A crate's `lib.rs`, a non-trivial commit) reviewed end-to-end by a fresh subagent before commit. Used in **Phase 2-3** for foundation crates whose API is downstream-critical.

**L3 — multi-axis parallel review** — dispatch 2-3 fresh subagents on different lenses (reuse / quality / efficiency / correctness) before commit. Used in **Phase 4 gate (killer binary)** and on any Layer A crate that ≥ 3 tools will depend on.

### How to dispatch

**Anthropic models (abundant, primary)** — use the Agent tool. Sonnet quota is unconstrained for this project (explicit user policy — prefer Sonnet for routine FreshEye work):

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet" | "opus" | "haiku",
  description: "FreshEye <level>: <topic>",
  prompt: "<self-contained brief: what to audit, what to check for, output format>"
)
```

**Codex (OpenAI GPT-5.x, quota-constrained)** — dispatch as a subagent via the Agent tool, but put `--effort medium` on the first line of the prompt. **Never `high` / `xhigh`** — quota expensive:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "codex:codex-rescue",
  description: "FreshEye <level> (codex): <topic>",
  prompt: "--effort medium\n\n<self-contained brief>"
)
```

First use of the session must precede with `Skill(codex:setup)` to confirm CLI ready. Spend Codex quota on: Phase 4 killer-binary L3 reviews, L2-triggered foundation-crate API reviews, cross-family second opinions. **Phase 1 catalog work does not use Codex** — Sonnet ↔ Opus internal review is sufficient.

**Gemini (Google Gemini 3.x, quota abundant)** — Gemini is a **Skill**, not a subagent. Dispatch via the Skill tool. The first line of `args` selects the model — `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` for heavy review, the flash-preview / 2.5-flash variants for light review. **Use the verified model IDs** (CLAUDE.md history had bare `gemini-3.1-pro` / `gemini-3.1-flash` which 404; the API requires the `-preview` suffix on the 3.x tier):

- Heavy: `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`
- Light: `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- Default (no `-m`): `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp`

```

  args: "Use gemini-3.1-pro-preview. <self-contained brief>"
)
```

First use of the session must precede with `Skill(gemini:setup)` to confirm CLI ready. **Gemini is third-party plugin so dispatch always with `run_in_background: true` and use Monitor / `/loop` to check completion**; do **not** sit on a synchronous Skill call and block when it hangs. If background dispatch never produces output, fall back to direct `Bash(run_in_background: true, command: "gemini -m <id> -p '<brief>'")` — that's the same CLI underneath. Quota is generous; spend freely on tests / fuzz / Cargo.toml audits and as the non-Codex non-Anthropic perspective.

**Cross-family selection rules**:

- Same-output **never** self-audited — Sonnet ↔ Opus internal pair-review is the default.
- Adding a non-Anthropic axis: `tests/` / non-production code / Cargo.toml → Gemini; `src/` production code fresh-eye → Codex medium.
- All three families: Phase 4 killer-binary L3 — Sonnet + Opus + Codex medium + Gemini-pro-preview for four-model differentiated perspectives. Gemini agent runs background; Anthropic + Codex finish first and Gemini's output joins when ready.

**Setup failure fallback**: if `codex:setup` / `gemini:setup` is unavailable in this session, FreshEye degrades to Anthropic-only (Sonnet ↔ Opus) — phase work continues but the gate report records `cross-family review unavailable this session, fallback to Anthropic-only` so review-strength downgrades surface to the user.

**Quota tracking**: autopilot maintains a running tally in `.autopilot/state/freshseye-budget.toml` of `codex-runs` and `gemini-runs` for the session, so the user can judge whether Phase 4's L3 budget still has room.

Never run FreshEye against output produced in the same context — `fresh` means fresh context.

### Mandatory triggers (any phase, regardless of declared level)

- About to commit a `pub` item in a foundation crate → L2 minimum.
- About to publish to crates.io → L3.
- Gate report drafted from > 200 individual decisions → L1-sample those decisions retroactively.
- Real-world test contradicts unit tests (especially platform-quirky details) → dispatch debug-focused FreshEye agent.
- The instruction `external_advice_must_question_assumption` applies recursively: a FreshEye finding is itself external advice and must be sanity-checked against deployment reality before action.

### Real-world testing — FreshEye's twin

Local CI + unit tests are necessary but not sufficient. For anything touching cross-platform / SSH / GPU / FS quirks, exercise on:

- mini_m2 (`/Volumes/Zane's HDD/`) — macOS + local FS
- `ssh 4090` (`/data3` fixtures, GPU) — Linux + perf + GPU
- GitHub Actions matrix — broad targets, no GPU

If a test passes on one and fails on another, the test is fragile, not the code.

## Universal stop conditions (any phase)

These are correctness gates, not process gates — they halt because continuing would emit something wrong or destroy recoverable state.

- About to commit a claim you couldn't verify → STOP, log to needs-review.
- About to invent a crate name / URL / version → STOP, log to needs-review.
- Three external signals diverge for one tool (crates.io / GitHub / source disagree) → STOP, document.
- Disk usage on `/` > 80% → STOP, audit cargo target placement.
- Architecture (2-layer / 4-quadrant / monorepo) looks wrong for the task at hand → never restructure unilaterally; surface to user.

Non-halt heuristics (recalibrate, don't stop):
- More than 5 unrelated files in one commit → wrong scoping, split the commit and continue.
- More than 3 iterations producing no meaningful diff → easy wins exhausted, change approach.
- `needs-review/` accumulates > 20 entries → schedule a batch-review pass, don't halt outright.
